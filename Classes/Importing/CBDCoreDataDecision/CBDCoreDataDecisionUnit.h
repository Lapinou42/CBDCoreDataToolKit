 CBDCoreDataDecisionUnit is a helper class for the library CBDCoreDataToolKit.
 
 CBDCoreDataDecisionUnit encapsulates the data for the decision relatively to an entity.
 
 A CBDCoreDataDecisionUnit instance refers to an NSEntityDescription and to some attributes and/or relationships to consider to do various actions (comparing, deleting, copying, etc.).

/**
 The designated initializer.
 
 A `CBDCoreDataDecisionUnit` will behave differently depending upon the @see `decisionType` of the `CBDCoreDataDecisionCenter` in which it is included. If the type of the center is "semi-facilitating" (meaning that by default, all the attributes are considered), and if you add to this center a unit that includes explicitely only one relationship, then both this relationship and all the attributes will be considered for actions.
 
 If you want, in this case, to have less attributes, you should use a `ignoringAttributes:` initializer.
