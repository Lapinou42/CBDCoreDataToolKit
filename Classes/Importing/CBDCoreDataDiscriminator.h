/**
 CBDCoreDataDiscriminator is a helper class for CBDCoreDataDiscriminator.
 
 Short:
 CBDCoreDataDiscriminator helps CBDCoreDataImporter to discriminate if two objects should be considered as the equal.
 
 Long:
 When you import an object from `sourceMOC` to `targetMOC`, you want to avoid some problems. For instance, your MOCs may refer to two different copies of the same data. In this case, your two MOCs won't have any object in common: in real, the objects are the same but on the computer, they will have a different `objectID` for instance.
 
 So, to deal with this issue, instead of comparing object with `==` (or with `isEqual:`, which will be the same in that case, we use CBDCoreDataDiscriminator.
 
 A CBDCoreDataDiscriminator instance refers to several CBDCoreDataDiscrimintorUnit instances

/**
 The following options deal with the case when an entity has no DiscriminatorUnit associated.
 
 Let's recall that a DiscriminatorUnit is meant to declare upon which attributes/relationships
 the objects of a given entity are compared.

 So, if an entity has no associated CBDCoreDataDiscriminatorResearchType, what to do ?
 
 We define three options :
 
 - CBDCoreDataDiscriminatorResearchFacilitating: all the objects of such entities will be declared equal. It
 is equivalent to ignoring this entity
 
 - CBDCoreDataDiscriminatorResearchSemiFacilitating: to compare two object of this entity, we only consider their attributes. This option is convenient but in some case, it could be too demanding, for instance if the objects of the given entity are markes with a `dateOfCreation` very precise.
 
 - CBDCoreDataDiscriminatorResearchSemiFacilitating: to compare two object of this entity, we only consider both all the attributes and all the relationships.
